# Let's talk about why VCMS won't be open sourced any time soon.

So, unfortunately, the only project that is in active use on corestormy.club that is not open source is VCMS, the visit counter microservice.

There's a couple of reasons for this:
  1. VCMS relies too heavily on IP addresses. Because of this, I can't put the repository out as I'd be giving out IP addresses. (And no, it doesn't work on environment variables either. The IP addresses are hardcoded.)
  1. The Stormy algorithmic checks can't be open source as this being open source will cause problems with me catching her visits.

So, will it be open source one day? Yes, with identifying information purged.

Is it any time soon? No, unfortunately.

Sorry. I wish it could be different, but I cannot risk it.
